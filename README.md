# Big data

## General info
- Repo to store code from course CPE 325 (Big data) by King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi
- Each folder contain my solution to lab. Some folders also have lecture codes that were mostly screenshots
- Machine learning labs that use scikit-learn are excluded from the repo for now
